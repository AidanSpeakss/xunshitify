# x-unshitify
Unshitify X, remove the addictive features, reduce unproductive usage, fix your life.

Simple and customizable user script to unshitify X/Twitter.
- Removes addictive features, such as badges on the notification icon.
- Removes features that ping you or notify you, interrupting your focus.
- Removes the infinite scroll feed entirely if you don't want to be distracted while responding to messages.
- Makes X/Twitter useful again, mainly for posting content and messaging people.

Star if you find it useful, but I don't really care, just want to share the script, I use it for myself every day.
